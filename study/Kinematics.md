# Kinematics

Kinematics treats only geometrical aspects of motion.

For marine craft moving in six **degrees of freedom** **(DOFs)**, six independent coordinates are necessary to determine the position and orientation. The first three coordinates, and their time derivatives, correspond to the position and translational motion along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes, while the last three coordinates and their time derivatives are used to describe orientation and rotational motion. For marine craft, the six different motion components are conveniently defined as *surge*, *sway*, *heave*, *roll*, *pitch* and *yaw* [[SNAME Notation]].
