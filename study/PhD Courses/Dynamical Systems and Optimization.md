## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to dynamical systems and optimization techniques, with a focus on their applications in control theory and artificial intelligence. Students will learn about finite (first and second order optimality conditions and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions for constrained optimization) and infinite optimization (first and second variations, and functional and metric spaces properties), calculus of variation (Euler-Lagrange equation and Legendre’s necessary condition), dynamical systems (state space representations, stability analysis, and controllabillity), optimal control theory (Pontryagin’s maximum principle for optimality), dynamic programming (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for optimality), and applications such as reinforcement learning.
