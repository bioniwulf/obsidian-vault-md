Article **A review of path following control strategies for autonomous robotic vehicles: Theory, simulations, and experiments**

Path following control strategies:
* Achieve path following by controlling (u, r )
* Achieve path following by controlling (u, r , γ˙)
* LOS path following
* Achieve path following by controlling (u, ψ, γ˙)
* NMPC‐based path following
* Achieve path following by controlling (u, r , γ¨)
* NMPC‐based path following

Basic outlines:
