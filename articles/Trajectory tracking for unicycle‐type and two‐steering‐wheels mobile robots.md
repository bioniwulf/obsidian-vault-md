Through two different approaches, this article proposes two general controllers for two- steering-wheels mobile robots. For both controllers, conditions for asymptotical convergence of the system toward a predefined path are established and simulation results are presented. Rather than writing the systems’ equations with respect to a fixed reference frame, the robot state is here parametrized relative to the followed path, in terms of distance and orientation.
