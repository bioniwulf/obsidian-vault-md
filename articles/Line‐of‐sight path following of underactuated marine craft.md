A 3 degrees of freedom (surge, sway, and yaw) nonlinear controller for path following of marine craft using only two controls is derived using nonlinear control theory. Path following is achieved by a geometric assignment based on a line-of-sight projection algorithm for minimization of the cross-track error to the path. The desired speed along the path can be specified independently. The control laws in surge and yaw are derived using backstepping. This results in a dynamic feedback controller where the dynamics of the uncontrolled sway mode enters the yaw control law. UGAS is proven for the tracking error dynamics in surge and yaw while the controller dynamics is bounded. A case study involving an experiment with a model ship is included to demonstrate the performance of the controller and guidance systems.
