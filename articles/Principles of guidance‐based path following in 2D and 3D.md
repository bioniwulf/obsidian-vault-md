This paper treats the subject of fundamental guidance principles related to motion behaviour in a 2D plane and a 3D space. In this context, the concept of guidance-based path following is defined and elaborated upon. Its specifies are contrasted towards the already established concept of trajectory tracking. Specifically, guidance laws are developed at an ideal, dynamics-independent level to yield generally valid laws uninfluenced by the particularities of any specific dynamics case. These laws can subsequently be tailored to actual target systems like e.g. watercraft or spacecraft, for instance in a cascaded setting. The approach renders all regular paths feasible. Possible applications and extensions to the guidance-based path following scheme are also briefly suggested.
