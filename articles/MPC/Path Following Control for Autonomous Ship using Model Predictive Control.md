Surface ships are, generally, underactuated, as they have more degrees of freedom than actuators, which lead to several difficulties in controlling them. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a modern control technique, which seeks to solve some of the problems that arise with classical control techniques by optimizing inputs over a finite period of time. The central goal in this study was implementing a MPC controller for path following, to be tested in a simulator developed by the Numerical Offshore Tank (TPN) of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. With such controller, we achieved a robust and efficient control, capable of adapting to different vessels and environmental conditions.
