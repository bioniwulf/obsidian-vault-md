The paper provides a reasonably accessible and self-contained tutorial exposition on model predictive control (MPC). It is aimed at readers with control expertise, particularly practitioners, who wish to broaden their perspective in the MPC area of control technology. We introduce the concepts, provide a framework in which the critical issues can be expressed and analyzed, and point out how MPC allows practitioners to address the trade-offs that must be considered in implementing a control technology.
